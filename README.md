# MeshCore

MeshCore is a powerful software solution designed to control the MotionMesh System of MeshNodes using the MeshPilot controller. This README provides an overview of the system's structure and functionality.

## System Structure

The MotionMesh System consists of the following components:

1. MeshNodes: These are the individual nodes that make up the mesh network. Each MeshNode is equipped with sensors and actuators to interact with the physical environment.

2. MeshPilot: The MeshPilot controller acts as the central hub for the entire system. It communicates with the MeshNodes and provides a user-friendly interface for controlling and monitoring the system.

3. MeshCore: This software, MeshCore, serves as the backbone of the system. It handles the communication between the MeshPilot and the MeshNodes, enabling seamless control and coordination.
